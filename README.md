Pongos
================

#What is it?

* Pongos is a very hard version of Pong.
* I don't go very far when I play, so report any bugs 
* If you're a developer, and you want to make it easier, fork it
* Its written in C, with some OO (without OO syntax).
* Its pretty well commented.

#How do I get it running?

* You have to build it yourself.
* For UNIX based systems (Mac OS X, Linux, etc.):
	cd pongos #or wherever the heck you've saved it	
	cd src 
	make
	./a.out
